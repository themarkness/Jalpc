It's been a while since I've posted anything on here, as i was using the blog for my MA Education work which I completed in 2017. However, I've not decided to use it to post up a few resources from various workshops that i'm doing in my current role managing user support for the [Micro:bit Educational Foundation](micro:bit.org "Micro:bit Educational Foundation")

October 4&5th saw the first ever micro:bit conference, [micro:bit Live](https://microbit.org/en/2019-04-12-microbit-live/ "micro:bit live") held at the BBC's Media City in Salford. It comprised of a range of talks, demonstrations and workshops from micro:bit enthusiasts across the globe.

I've been thinking for a while about how the little device could be used for a range of arts and performance activities alongside Computer Science and also for CPD activities in educational technology settings. As a result I submitted a workshop for micro:bit Live, entitled the 'micro:bit noise ensemble'. 

At  the time of submission I had a vague idea of running a workshop that focussed on the micro:bit as a musical instrument and performance technology in it's own right, not connected to things like servos or motors to produce sound via something else eg playing a xylophone ( though there are some mightily cool projects that do this)
