It's been a while since I've posted anything on here, as i was using the blog for my MA Education work which I completed in 2017. However, I've not decided to use it to post up a few resources from various workshops that i'm doing in my current role managing user support for the [Micro:bit Educational Foundation](micro:bit.org "Micro:bit Educational Foundation")

October 4&5th saw the first ever micro:bit conference, [micro:bit Live](https://microbit.org/en/2019-04-12-microbit-live/ "micro:bit live") held at the BBC's Media City in Salford. It comprised of a range of talks, demonstrations and workshops from micro:bit enthusiasts across the globe.

I've been thinking for a while about how the little device could be used for a range of arts and performance activities alongside Computer Science and also for CPD activities in educational technology settings. As a result I submitted a workshop for micro:bit Live, entitled the 'micro:bit noise ensemble'.

At  the time of submission I had a vague idea of running a workshop that focussed on the micro:bit as a musical instrument and performance technology in it's own right, not connected to things like servos or motors to produce sound via something else eg playing a xylophone/drum.  There are some mightily cool projects that do this though, including Cpt. Credible's[ micro:bit orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tX93t7jCbQ "micro:bit orchestra") that performed live at micro:bit Live!

I iterated on the idea, thinking I could focus solely on noise making in Python using the speech mode and testing out the REPL in the [Python Editor Beta](Python Editor beta) as a sort of live coding event a la SonicPi and I also thought about getting the group to draw a score in pencil and 'play' it with the micro:bit and in the end I went with both of those ideas (albeit a bit slimmed down) and a whole lot more.

Here are the links to the presentation and the associated worksheets
